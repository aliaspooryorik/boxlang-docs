# 1.0.0-Beta17

In this release, we've introduced the exciting addition of websockets support to BoxLang through the powerful [SocketBox](https://forgebox.io/view/socketbox) module. This enhancement is not limited to our [CommandBox](../../getting-started/running-boxlang/commandbox.md) Runtime but also extends to our [MiniServer](../../getting-started/running-boxlang/miniserver.md) runtime, creating a more dynamic and efficient framework for real-time communication. For an in-depth introduction to these features, please visit our community post [here](https://community.ortussolutions.com/t/introducing-socketbox-a-new-websocket-library/10381/4).

Additionally, we've implemented several new features and improvements.  We've also improved the system startup process by adding version and build date information to the MiniServer startup output ([BL-607](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-607)). Lastly, we've addressed session management by ensuring that application settings are readily accessible during the `onSessionEnd` event ([BL-610](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-610)). This release encapsulates our ongoing commitment to providing robust, cutting-edge solutions for developers and reaching stable release in the coming weeks.
