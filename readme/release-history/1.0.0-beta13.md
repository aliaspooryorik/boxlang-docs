# 1.0.0-Beta13

This release introduces several new features aimed at enhancing the usability and functionality of BoxLang.  We have closed a tremendous amounts of bugs on this release in order to bring more compatibility and stability to BoxLang.  We have also started to introduce performance enhancements and more innovations as we progress towards final release.

Enjoy!

## New Features

### [BL-142](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-142) Writedump output support

We have finalized the `console` output for the dump component, but we have also added the following ticket:

[BL-508](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-508) New dump event to listen when an non-core output is detected so modules can handle it. `onMissingDumpOutput`

Which will allow module developers to collaborate their own output destinations for any dump in the language.  This is something we have wanted for years and it's now a possibility.  Just listen to the `onMissingDumpOutput` interception point, you get all the arguments to the BIF or component and you decide where things will go.  VScode Dump Panel, here we come.

The `console` output has also been enhanced where everything will be pretty printed, including labels.

### [BL-489](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-489) Ability to mark a @BoxBif as excluded from documentation

This is more of an internal documentation process for the team.



### [BL-504](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-504) New dump template for Java instants

Java Instants will now be dumped nicely with an internal representation and a human readable representation.



### [BL-507](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-507) dump showUDFs

All the arguments for dumps are now available including this one for controlling the dumping of UDFs on classes.
