# 1.0.0-Beta15

Welcome to Beta 15!  This release brings several significant enhancements aimed at improving the efficiency and functionality of the CLI environment and continued bug fixing to bring our CFML compatibility to several client applications and Ortus Libraries. Key among these is the introduction of the `bx-web-support` module, which allows the CLI to interface with web server capabilities, making it an excellent tool for testing and feature auditing. Additionally, the merge capabilities within module settings have been refined to support deep merges from the configuration file, ensuring greater flexibility and control.

Moreover, running scripts or classes via CLI execution now supports the automatic detection and execution of `Application.bx|cfc`, streamlining the process for developers. The new `ToString` dump template enhances debugging by enabling a concise display format for lists of Java objects, simplifying the analysis and debugging process.

Overall, this beta release brings further stability for CFML applications migrating to BoxLang!

## New Features

### [BL-544](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-544) Look and execute for Application.bx|cfc when running scripts or classes via CLI execution

We have always wanted even further CLI enhancements for applications built with BoxLang.  Now you get it!  BoxLang will look for an `Application.bx|cfc` whenever it executes a template or class and follow the process of application startup, settings, ORM, etc.  The full life-cycle of an application but at the CLI level.  This will allow you to completely test your web applications with no web server and even build CLI applications with easy application constructs!

### [BL-559](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-559) New bx-web-support module to support the CLI with web server capabilities. Great for testing, mocking and feature audits.

We have released the `bx-web-support` module which will give you mocking, testing and auditing capabilities for CLI testing and runners.  This means that your CLI applications will look and feel like a real web application with a real web server, but using our mock approaches.

This module is still in it's alpha stages so expect much more development on it.

### [BL-574](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-574) Module settings should have a deep merge from the configuration file

All module settings in your `boxlang.json` can now be deeply merged automatically by BoxLang. &#x20;

### [BL-580](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-580) Add a new ToString dump template that will take a list of java objects to display them in short hand format

We will be easing the visibility of certain human readable Java classes in our dump templates.

### [BL-581](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-581) Handle single values in arrayAppend merge=true

A nice feature to support further merging techniques with arrays.
