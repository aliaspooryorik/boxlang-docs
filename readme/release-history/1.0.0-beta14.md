# 1.0.0-Beta14

In this release, we are excited to introduce several new features and enhancements aimed at improving functionality and user experience. These updates include the creation of immutable query types, new server keys to aid on CLI tooling, and methods to identify runtime initiation modes.&#x20;

Additionally, we've added an event announcement for dump rendering to enable better integration with external listeners. Read on to learn more about these features and how they can benefit your workflow.

Code Strong!

## New Features

### [BL-93](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-93) Create immutable query type

We have now introduced the immutable query type.  Any query in BoxLang can become immutable by just calling the `toImmutable()` method on it.  This will lock the query into read-only mode.  Great for multi-threaded operations or just data safety.  You can also unlock immutable types via the `toMutable()` method.

```cfscript
// Just call the toImmutable() to lock the type
myData = myDataService.queryData().toImmutable()

// You can also unlock it via the toMutable() method
unlockedData = myData.toMutable()
```



### [BL-529](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-529) Announce the onBXDump whenever a dump is about to be rendered, to allow for external listeners to receive the dump

We have added a new global listener for the language: `onBxDump` which allows you to listen to any call to our dump component.  This will allow developers to tap into the dumping facilities and intercept the dump calls.  We are doing this in order to bring real-time dump facilities to VSCode.

```cfscript
function onBxDump( data ){
  .. listen to the dump call
}
```

All the arguments from the `dump` bif/component will be passed through.



### [BL-538](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-538) New runtime inCLIMode() method to tell you if the runtime was started via the runtime or something else

This is a new method in the `BoxRuntime` which allows developers or module authors to know if your runtime is in CLI mode or not.  The `server.boxlang` also contains much more information about the modes you are in:

* `server.boxlang.cliMode` - True or false if you are in CLI mode
* `server.boxlang.jarMode` - True or false if running in JAR mode
* `server.boxlang.runtimeHome` - The runtime home seeded in the runtime

### [BL-539](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-539) New server.cli key to provide you with all the CLI options used to run the runtime

There is a new `server.cli` structure that will assist CLI developers.  It contains the following data:

* `server.cli.executionPath` - From what directory was the runtime command called from
* `server.cli.command` - The full raw commandline string used by the OS to call the binary + your command
* `server.cli.args` - The raw array of arguments the command was called with
* `server.cli.parsed.options` - A struct of name-value pairs of all the options detected in the CLI arguments.
* `server.cli.parsed.positionals` - An array of positional arguments sent to the CLI

BoxLang will detect and parse the following conditions into the `options` struct:

* `--{name}` - Will crete a key called `{name}` with a value of `true`
* `--!{name}` - Will crete a key called `{name}` with a value of `false`
* `--no-{name}` - Will crete a key called `{name}` with a value of `false`
* `-{character}` - Shorthands using a single character.  The value will be `true` and the key will be  the character used. Example: `-p`
* `-{characters}` - You can use multi-shorthand characters and each of them will be keys in the struct with a value of `true`. Example: `-abc` will create `a=true, b=true, c=true`
* `--{name}=value` - Will create a key called `{name}` with the value from the right side of the equals sign.
* `--{name}="value"` - Will create a key called `{name}` with the value from the right side of the equals sign and removing the quotes.
* `--{name}='value'` - Will create a key called `{name}` with the value from the right side of the equals sign and removing the single quotes



### [BL-540](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/BL-540) Refactor the CLIOptions to it's own class and add a simple argument parser

In preparation to the inclusion of CommandBox commands into BoxLang we have also added our CLI utility to assist with argument parsing and detection. We have also encapsulated our CLI tooling in preparation for more in the next betas.
